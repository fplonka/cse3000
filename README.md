# CSE3000: Donâ€™t follow the leader: Independent thinkers create scientific innovatoin

This repository contains the code used for the research I did as part of the TU Delft CSE Research Project (CSE3000). The Go code is used for downloading and preprocessing the [S2AG](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3487553.3527147) dataset, the Elixir Livebook was used for early data exploration and some supplementary analysis and visualisation, and the Python scripts in the w*/ folders contain the key computations and visualisations. 

Some smaller computed datasets are included in the w*/ folders. The structure of the datasets/ folder is replicated but with empty files, as these datasets are excessively large.
